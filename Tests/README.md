# Why are the tests not implemented?


This thought is based on a talk given by [Ian Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM). Given that the app I am writing will never see a daylight, it would be a heavy waste of time to write tests for it, though I understand how necessary testing is. Keeping that in mind, instead of implementing any tests, I thought I'm gonna give an example of how I would go about testing each of the implemented behaviors and describing why would they be necessary for a potential client.
